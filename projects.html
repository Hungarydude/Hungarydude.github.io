        <td>During the creation of my app, “Bongo Cat Taiko”, I came up with the idea since it was based upon two subjects: Bongo Cat and Taiko. Bongo Cat became an online trend on social media, personally, I adored the trend since it was both cute and funny. Likewise, with the second subject, Taiko, was brought up because I enjoy an online game called “Osu”, a simple rhythm game. One of the sub-game modes was a Japanese arcade game by the name of “Taiko”. Combining these two subjects seems genius and trendy. At first thought the idea seemed simple enough, simply make a rhythm game with a cute cat hitting a bongo to a song; however, it was not as simple as I expected. Creating this project was a turmoil to my brain, I had a plan to begin, but at the same time, I was clueless on the end. After creating this app I realized two major mentalities. First, I focus too much on the formatting rather than the project itself, in other words, I go for the end look rather than creating the code to create the game itself, sounds pretty stupid right? Secondly, I under-thought about challenges I was to come across, for example: creating variables for timing, moving the notes to the area when the buttons should be pressed, a pause screen, etc… This project was an eye-opener for me, it now gives me the respect to those coders and game designers who create such a masterpiece for us. In our society, today people have such a high standard for those who are talented and believe they are the norm. To add, this project also makes me want to strive in this area of expertise for my career for the main reasons of enjoyment and the feel of succession once a project has been completed.
