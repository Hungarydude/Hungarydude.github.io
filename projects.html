        <td>For my app, Bongo Cat Taiko  I took the concept of two subjects: Bongo Cat and Taiko. Bongo Cat became an online trend on social media; personally, I adored the trend because it was both cute and funny. On the other hand, the second subject came to mind due to my enjoyment of an online game called Osu- a simple rhythm game. One of the sub-game modes is a Japanese arcade game by the name of Taiko.<br></br>Combining these two subjects seemed, to me, both genius and trendy. At first thought, the idea seemed simple enough- simply make a rhythm game with a cute cat hitting a bongo to a song. However, it was not as simple as I expected. Creating this project caused turmoil in my brain; I had a general idea, but at the same time I was clueless in the end.<br></br>After creating this app I realized two major issues with my process of creation. Firstly, I focus too much on the formatting rather than the project itself; I go for the end look rather than creating the code to create the game itself, which sounds pretty redundant in hindsight. Secondly, I underestimated the amount of challenges I would come across. For example: creating variables for timing, moving the notes to the area when the buttons should be pressed, a pause screen, etcâ€¦ <br></br>This project was an eye-opener for me- it has given me a newfound respect for those coders and game designers who create such masterpieces for the us, the consumers.<br></br>In today's society, people have created such a high standard for those who are talented and believe they are more "average" than they really are. In addition, this project also makes me want to strive for personal improvement in this area of expertise for my future career. My goal is improving overall enjoyment and reaching that feeling of success once a project has been completed.</td>
