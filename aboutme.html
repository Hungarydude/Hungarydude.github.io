  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <img src="me.jpg" width=480px style="float: left;"></img>
  <p id="text">Hello, I am Adrian Lindhardt. To begin, my goal in the future is to be a game designer. Currently I am attending Palm Desert High School and will be graduated by June of 2020. The main reason for me choosing this career was simply the fact since I love video games as well as art and design. I perceived that since these two aspects of creativity I greatly relish, this could be my so-called “dream job.” From here I must figure out a way to achieve my goal of this career path. Moreforth, to reach my goal of a game designer I need to familiarize myself with bits and pieces of the career -as I am doing by being enrolled in Computer Science at PDHS- so my future can be easier when I have already know the basics of the material. In the near future, when I will be attending my next school after  high school, I will be beginning the basics of my future and my first steps in legal-hood as a legal adult. For now I have yet to know where I will end up, but I hope it will take me on the path I perceive.</p>
  <p id="text">To follow, I -like most people- acquire strengths as well as weaknesses. To list my strengths, my uniqueness come from how I interact with others. I can be very motivated and wholesome; spicing that up with a bit of humor. I am always trying more humble since I can get cocky about things I have created or done to take pride in my work, which leads to my other weaknesses. Once someone gets in a bonding friendship with me I could easily talk their ears off -you could even ask my friends- as well as collaborating with others without my choice since as I explained earlier, I can be hard to get to know.</p>
  <p id="text">All in all, I am just a casual high schooler seeking for my future’s success. Using what I know about myself and to improve my weaknesses to be the best person I can become. Therefore, to end my personal information I would like to thank you for exploring my personal website and hope you enjoy exploring it.</p>
